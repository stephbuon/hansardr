Description: hansardr supplies data subsets of the 19th-century British Parliamentary debates, also known as Hansard. 
The data was scrapped from UK Parliament's historic Hansard API (https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/volumes/index.html) and underwent corrections for systemic issues which had caused some debates to be marked as "missing" from the corpus. Speaker names were disambiguated using distance measurements.
